****WARNING***** -These instructions will not work unless you have SSH enabled on you Pi beforehand!!!

Hey all, 
this was an issue I had when I only had SSH (secure shell), a laptop and Ethernet cable. I had no idea how to see what was going on my Pi desktop one day out on the town.
So rocking a Windows 10 craptop*, an ethernet cable and my trusty Pi 3b+ I looked for an answer.

Sparring you the hour of research i had to go through let me just give you a little cheat sheat. 

what you need:  
- download PUTTY and VNC on you laptop
-the name of your pi (if its new then its probrably just gonna be "pi")
-ethernet connection between your pi and computer

What to do:
1. establish SSH connection through putty (port 22) by typing in your Pi's name and then clicking open
2. log into your pi throught the SSH connection and type in "sudo raspi-config" into the terminal
3. once you are at the settings screen go to the interface seection and enable VNC on boot.
4. Reboot your Pi and re-establish SSH connection.
5. type "vncserver" in the terminal and it should pull out all the info you need to establish a connection with your laptop.

to set up the vnc connection just type in the VNC server IP and connect to screenshare and from there you can connect your Pi to the wifi and then establish a vnc connection
that way if you wanted to get rid of the Ethernet cable.
